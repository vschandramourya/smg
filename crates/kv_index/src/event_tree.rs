//! Positional indexer for cache-aware routing.
//!
//! Uses a single `DashMap<(usize, ContentHash), IndexEntry>` keyed by (position, content_hash).
//! Unbounded by default; [`PositionalIndexer::prune`] optionally bounds it with a
//! last-touch TTL and/or a capacity ceiling (oldest-first eviction).
//! Jump search skips positions in strides, yielding amortized O(D/J + W) complexity.
//!
//! **Dual-hash scheme**: backends send a position-aware `block_hash` (SequenceHash)
//! and raw `token_ids` per block. The router computes a position-independent
//! ContentHash (XXH3) from token_ids, then a rolling prefix hash (also XXH3) from
//! the ContentHash sequence. SeqEntry is keyed by the router's prefix hash for
//! precise disambiguation at query time. The backend's SequenceHash is stored in
//! worker_blocks only, used for `apply_removed` reverse lookup.
//!
//! **Performance**: Internal u32 worker IDs eliminate Arc<str> hashing and atomic
//! refcount bouncing in the hot query loop. Caller-owned `WorkerBlockMap` gives
//! direct HashMap access (~5ns) on the write path — no DashMap hash+shard locking.
//! Atomic tree_sizes provide O(1) size queries.
//!
//! Thread safety: the shared `index` DashMap is internally synchronized via sharding.
//! `WorkerBlockMap` is caller-owned (one per tokio task), so no cross-thread
//! synchronization is needed on the write path.
