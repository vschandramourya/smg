//! The index engine: one `radix_tree::RadixTree` per keyspace, with
//! epoch-scoped holder state, per-feed eviction semantics, and
//! overlap queries. Pure and synchronous — the gRPC surface, relay,
//! and bootstrap live in `server.rs`.
//!
//! Correctness model (see `.claude/kv-index-service/01-design.md`):
//! - Event feed: one worker-sequenced stream per (holder, epoch); apply
//!   in order, dedup on `seq <= last_seq`, batch-shaped (one seq may mix
//!   Stored and Removed).
//! - Placement feed: unsequenced (`seq == 0`), idempotent by content —
//!   publishers synthesize identical chains for identical prefixes, so
//!   cross-publisher ordering never matters.
//! - Epochs: a higher epoch clears all lower-epoch state for the holder;
//!   lower-epoch updates are dropped. Restarts and cursor loss are both
//!   epoch bumps, which is what makes relaying `Cleared` safe.
//! - Feed authority: a holder becomes event-fed on its first observed
//!   removal (or an explicit `Added { event_fed: true }`); inferred
//!   Stored updates for an event-fed holder are dropped.
//! - Freshness is holder-granular: idle inferred holders are cleared
//!   by TTL, idle dropped holders are RETIRED entirely. Capacity is
//!   runaway protection only (truncate past 2x declared, tail-first
//!   and prefix-closed) — the placement feed has no removal signal,
//!   so index-side eviction must never race the worker's own.
