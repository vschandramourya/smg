/*
    Cache-Aware Load Balancing Router

    When load is balanced, uses cache-aware routing. When imbalanced, uses
    LeastLoad expected-wait routing. A system is imbalanced when both:
        (max - min) > abs_threshold  AND  max > rel_threshold * min

    Three types of cache-aware routing (mutually exclusive, selected by
    worker connection mode and KV event availability):

    1. Event-Driven (gRPC + KV events)
    -------------------------------------------
    Uses PositionalIndexer overlap scoring from KvEventMonitor. Routes based
    on actual backend KV cache state. Selects the worker with the highest
    overlap count; LeastLoad breaks equal-affinity ties atomically.
    Falls back to LeastLoad when no cache overlap exists.

    2. Approximate Token Tree (gRPC, no KV events)
    -------------------------------------------
    Maintains a TokenTree per model tracking which token prefixes were routed
    where. If match_rate > cache_threshold, routes to the best-matching worker.
    Otherwise routes with LeastLoad's expected-wait algorithm.

    3. Approximate String Tree (HTTP)
    -------------------------------------------
    Same algorithm as (2) but operates on raw text characters instead of
    token IDs, avoiding tokenization overhead.

    Cache Namespaces (cache_salt / extra_key / LoRA)
    -------------------------------------------
    A request that carries cache-partition fields keys the approximate trees
    and the hash index under a namespace marker (see cache_namespace.rs), so
    requests the engine cannot serve from one cache never match each other.
    Every live namespace holds its own copy of a shared prefix: max_tree_size
    bounds the SUM across namespaces, so size it for tenants x working set,
    and a per-request salt makes every request a unique path. The
    event-driven mode is unpartitioned (both sides re-hash token ids), and
    the typed gRPC/ZMQ wires stay unpartitioned until they forward the fields
    to the engine.

    Load Balancing (Expected Wait)
    -------------------------------------------
    When the system is imbalanced, routes to LeastLoad's atomic expected-wait
    winner regardless of cache affinity.

    Hash Index Under-Layer (cache_index = hash)
    -------------------------------------------
    Replaces all three tree modes with a TTL'd exact-match placement map
    keyed on request heads at the cache_boundaries token positions; the
    radix trees are neither consulted nor populated. Selection probes
    boundaries deepest-first for a live holder and records the dispatched
    worker at every applicable boundary.

    Configuration Parameters:
    ------------------------
    cache_threshold:         Min prefix match ratio for highest-match routing (0.0-1.0)
    balance_abs_threshold:   Absolute load diff threshold for imbalance detection
    balance_rel_threshold:   Relative load ratio threshold for imbalance detection
    eviction_interval_secs:  Interval between LRU eviction / TTL sweep cycles
    max_tree_size:           Max total size (chars/tokens) of each model's approximate tree,
                             shared across all workers; enforced by eviction
    block_size:              Backend KV cache block size for event-driven routing
    cache_index:             Under-layer: tree (radix trees) or hash (placement map)
    cache_ttl_secs:          Seconds a hash-index placement stays routable
    cache_boundaries:        Ascending token positions for hash-index keying
